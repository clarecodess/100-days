# 100 Days of Code

A challenge to improve as a developer by building on the foundation I established in coding bootcamp. 

## Why 100 Days of Code?
* Reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned during bootcamp
* Explore new technologies and frameworks
* Work on personal projects
* Contribute to open-source projects

## My Plan for 100 Days of Code
1. Code for at least an hour a day.
2. Document progress on my blog, Twitter and LinkedIn. Host the code on Github.
3. Work on a varoety of projects and challenges to understand new and old concepts.
